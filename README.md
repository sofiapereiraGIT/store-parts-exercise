# Welcome

This project was created considering the exercise requirements of [MOZANTECH STORE-PARTS-EXERCISE](https://github.com/Mozantech/store-parts-exercise).
This code consumes the API created on [MOZANTECH STORE-PARTS-EXERCISE](https://github.com/Mozantech/store-parts-exercise), so put both of the projects running.

## How to run the API

Go to [MOZANTECH STORE-PARTS-EXERCISE](https://github.com/Mozantech/store-parts-exercise) and run

```
npm install
npm run start
```

## How to run this APP

```

Check **coverage/lcov-report/index.html** to see the report in the browser.

### Comments

A store was not implemented, due to not being part of the requirements, but could be to not lose the state of the filters and the table when changing between pages.
